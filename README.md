The approach to investment return and risk varies with the investor and their stage
in life.  A prudent investor that
does not need to access their investments for twenty years might be willing to accept
higher risk in return for higher long term gains. A prudent investor who is near or at
retirement age would have much less tolerance for risk.

<p>
The Holy Grail of investing would be market (e.g., S&P 500) returns or better with
much less risk (like the Holy Grail, this is generally unattainable).

This Jupyter notebook investigates a stock market trading algorithm that is often referred
to as ETF rotation. The ETF rotation algorithm has less risk
and, in some cases, better returns than a "buy and hold" algorithm (see
<a href="https://github.com/IanLKaplan/all_weather_portfolio/blob/master/all_weather_portfolio.ipynb">All Weather" Portfolios</a>)
For example, the ETF rotation algorithm described in this notebook had higher
returns with less risk than the S&P 500 for
a portfolio investment that started in 2008 to 2019. After 2019 the return of the
ETF rotation portfolio was equal or less than the S&P 500.
